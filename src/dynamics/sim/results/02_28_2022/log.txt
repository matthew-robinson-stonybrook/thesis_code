V1: 
ONLY Mass and Coriolis matrix used
Was missing negative signs so this is fixed
time step (h) = 0.005s
total time = 5s
initial q1: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
initial q2: {pi/4, pi/4, pi/4, pi/4, pi/4, pi/4, pi/4};

V2: Pendulum 
Mass Coriolis matrices and Gravity term used
time step (h) = 0.005s
total time = 5s
initial q1: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
initial q2: {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
